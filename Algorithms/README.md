## Sum from 1 to n

Features: Number ``n`` entered as ``main()`` argument

Handle error:

* Must enter 1 parameter for n, less than 1 or more than 1 parameter is not accepted.
* Accept value of ``n`` is integer ``2147483647``
* Negative number is not accepted
* Invalid number ``123abc`` is not accepted (for the parsing operation of ``atoi()``)

For the max accepted number of ``2147483647``, the result must be ``unsigned long int``, not ``int``.

## Saddle point

Find [saddle point](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/tree/master/Introduction/Data%20structure/Array#saddle-point) in a 2D array. Also check [saddle point document](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/tree/master/Introduction/Data%20structure/Array#saddle-point) for the method to find saddle point inside a 2D array.
