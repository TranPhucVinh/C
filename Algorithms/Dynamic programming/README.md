Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems, which are solved independently. The solutions to these subproblems are stored, typically in a table, to avoid redundant computations and to ensure that each subproblem is solved only once. This method is especially useful for optimization problems.
