# Linux signal

All **Unix** and **Unix-like** standards signals are divided into:
* Program error signals
* Termination Signals
* Alarm Signals
* Asynchronous I/O Signals
* Job Control Signals
* Operation Error Signals
* Miscellaneous Signals
## [Program error signals](Documents/Program%20error%20signals.md)
* [SIGFPE](Documents/Program%20error%20signals.md#sigfpe) (**Signal Floating-Point Exception**): Erroneous arithmetic operation, such as zero divide or an operation resulting in overflow (not necessarily with a floating-point operation).
* **SIGILL** (Signal Illegal Instruction): Invalid function image, such as an illegal instruction. This is generally due to a corruption in the code or to an attempt to execute data.
* [SIGSEGV](Documents/Program%20error%20signals.md#sigsegv) (**Signal Segmentation Violation**): Memory access violation, e.g trying to read or write from/to a memory area that your process does not have access to, when a program tries to read or write outside the memory it is allocated for it.
* [SIGBUS](Documents/Program%20error%20signals.md#sigbus): SIGBUS is triggered when
  * A bus error is a fault raised by hardware, notifying an operating system (OS) that a process is trying to access memory that the CPU cannot physically address.
  * Process tries to access an undefined virtual memory address. Although trying to access an undefined virtual memory address is generally considered to be a segmentation fault rather than a bus error, the processor cannot tell the difference and treats it as the SIGBUS.
* **SIGABRT** (Signal Abort): Abnormal termination, such as is initiated by the function.
* SIGTRAP
* SIGSYS

## [Termination signals](Documents/Termination%20signals.md)
* **SIGTERM** (**Signal Terminate**): politely ask a program to terminate. Unlike [SIGKILL](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigkill), this signal can be blocked, handled, and ignored.
* [SIGINT](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigtstp-and-sigint) (**Signal Interrupt**): Interactive attention signal. Generally generated by the application user, like **Ctr+C**
* **SIGQUIT**: **SIGQUIT** signal is similar to [SIGINT](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigtstp-and-sigint)
* [SIGKILL](Documents/Termination%20signals.md#sigkill): immediately terminate a process, **SIGKILL** cannot be caught, handled or ignored. It is impossible to block this signal.
* [SIGHUP](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sighup-sigusr1-sigusr2-can-stop-a-process-without-signal_handler-required) can be used to stop a process without signal_handler() required.
## Alarm signals
* SIGALRM  
* SIGVTALRM
* SIGPROF
## [Asynchronous I/O signals](Documents/Asynchronous%20IO%20signals.md)
* [SIGIO](Documents/Asynchronous%20IO%20signals.md): SIGIO is sent when a file descriptor is ready to perform I/O, especially terminals and sockets.
* SIGURG
## Job Control Signals
* [SIGCHLD](../Process/Process%20cloning/Signal%20for%20fork().md#sigchld): When a child process stops or terminates, SIGCHLD is sent to the parent process.
* [SIGCONT](../Process/system()%20for%20a%20process%20with%20infinite%20loop%20in%20the%20background.md#stop%20child_process%20by%20SIGSTOP%20and%20continue%20it%20by%20SIGCONT): **SIGCONT** will continue the process continue from the state where it is stopped by **SIGSTOP**. Implementation: [Stop a process by SIGSTOP and continue it by SIGCONT from another process](../Process/system()%20for%20a%20process%20with%20infinite%20loop%20in%20the%20background.md#stop-child_process-by-sigstop-and-continue-it-by-sigcont)
* [SIGSTOP](../Process/system()%20for%20a%20process%20with%20infinite%20loop%20in%20the%20background.md#stop%20child_process%20by%20SIGSTOP%20and%20continue%20it%20by%20SIGCONT): **SIGSTOP** will stop/suspend a process. **SIGCONT** will let that process continue from the state where it is stopped. Implementation: [Stop a process by SIGSTOP and continue it by SIGCONT from another process](../Process/system()%20for%20a%20process%20with%20infinite%20loop%20in%20the%20background.md#stop-child_process-by-sigstop-and-continue-it-by-sigcont)
* [SIGTSTP](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigtstp-and-sigint): Stop a process, mapped to **Ctr+Z**
* [SIGTTIN](Working%20with%20specific%20signals.md#sigttin): When a background job tries to read from its current terminal, SIGTTIN will be triggered
* [SIGTTOU](Working%20with%20specific%20signals.md#sigttou): When a background job tries to write from its current terminal and the current terminal has flag ``TOSTOP`` set, SIGTTOU will be triggered
## Operation Error Signals
* SIGPIPE
* SIGXCPU
* SIGXFSZ
## Miscellaneous Signals
* [SIGUSR1](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigusr1-and-sigusr2) (along with **SIGUSR2**) is user defined signal
* [SIGUSR2](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigusr1-and-sigusr2) (along with **SIGUSR1**) is user defined signal
* [SIGWINCH](Working%20with%20specific%20signal.md#sigwinch): a signal sent upon the resizing of a window. When the number of columns or rows changes, **SIGWINCH** is raised to the foreground processes attached to the terminal.

# Implementation

* **Blocking Signals**: Blocking a signal means telling the operating system to hold it and deliver it later. 
* **Signal mask**: The collection of signals that are currently blocked is called the signal mask.
* **Signal set**: All of the signal blocking functions use a data structure called a signal set (``sigset_t``) to specify what signals are affected.

Implementations include:
* [IPC by signal](IPC%20by%20signal.md)
* [Process signal mask](Process%20signal%20mask.md)
* [Stopping and interrupting signals](): SIGTSTP, SIGINT and SIGKILL; SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 can stop a process without ``signal_handler()``
* [Working with specific signals](Working%20with%20specific%20signals.md)

# [API](API.md)

All signals are defined in library ``signal.h`` in C Standard Library.

* [kill()]()
* [signal()]()
* [sigaction()]()
* [sigqueue()]()
* [sigprocmask()]()
* [pause()]()
