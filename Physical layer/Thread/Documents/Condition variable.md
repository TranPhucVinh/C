Mutex provides mutual exclusion for accessing the shared variable, while the condition variable is used to signal changes in the variableâ€™s state. Pthread condition variable is used in multithread which have already involved mutex.

# One thread unblocks another thread
In this example, after increasing the ``shared_value`` to its ``RANGE``, thread 1 will set flag ``thread_2_run`` to allow thread 2 to run. After being "enabled" by flag ``thread_2_run``, thread 2 will increase the ``shared_value`` to ``RANGE``. This example is quite similar to [One thread function handler to increase a shared value issue](#one-thread-function-handler-to-increase-a-shared-value), except ``thread_1`` uses flag ``thread_2_run`` to enable ``thread_2`` to run.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>

#define RANGE 3000000

int shared_value;

void *thread_func_1(void *ptr);
void *thread_func_2(void *ptr);
int thread_2_run = 0;

pthread_mutex_t lock;

int main()
{  
	pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
	pthread_t thread_1, thread_2;
	int thread_1_return, thread_2_return;

	thread_1_return = pthread_create(&thread_1, NULL, thread_func_1, "Thread 1");
    thread_2_return = pthread_create(&thread_2, NULL, thread_func_2, "Thread 2");
	pthread_join(thread_1, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread_2, NULL);
    printf("shared_value after executing 2 threads: %d\n", shared_value);
	pthread_mutex_destroy(&lock);
}

void *thread_func_1(void *ptr){
    printf("Thread 1 starts\n");
	for (int i = 0; i < RANGE; i++) {
		if(!pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)){
			shared_value++;
			pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
		} else printf("%s fails to lock\n", (char*)ptr);
    }   
    thread_2_run = 1;
    printf("shared_value after thread 1: %d\n", shared_value);
}

void *thread_func_2(void *ptr){
    printf("Thread 2 starts\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < RANGE; i++) {
        if(!pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)){
        while(!thread_2_run){
            printf("Thread 2 isn't ready to run\n");
            sleep(1);
        }
        shared_value++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
        } else printf("%s fails to lock\n", (char*)ptr);
    }
    printf("shared_value after thread 2: %d\n", shared_value);
}
```
**Result**
```
Thread 1 starts
Thread 2 starts
Thread 2 isn't ready to run
Thread 2 isn't ready to run
...// Loop forever
```

**Problem solved by pthread condition variable**: [cond_signal_2_threads.c](../src/cond_signal_2_threads.c)

**Result**
```
Thread 1 starts
Thread 2 starts
Not ready to run
shared_value after thread 1: 3000000
shared_value after thread 2: 6000000
shared_value after executing 2 threads: 6000000
```
# One thread unblocks multiple threads
For thread 1 to allow multiple other threads, e.g thread 2, thread 3 to run, we must use [pthread_cond_broadcast()]() to broadcast the condition variable from thread 1.

**Program**: [cond_broadcast.c](../src/cond_broadcast.c)

**Result**
```
Not ready to run
Not ready to run
share_value after executing 3 threads: 9000000
```
# Run multiple threads respectively by condition variables
Run thread 1, 2 and 3 respectively by using condition variables: [cond_signal_multiple_threads.c](../src/cond_signal_multiple_threads.c). Also note that this program implementation doesn't include mutex
