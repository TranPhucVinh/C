# User-space and kernel-space
* **User-space** refers to the environment where user applications run, and they have limited privileges. Processes running in user-space cannot directly interact with hardware or system resources (e.g., memory, devices) and need to request services through system calls.
* **Kernel-space** is where the operating system kernel operates, with full control over the systemâ€™s hardware and resources. IPC mechanisms often involve the kernel since the kernel manages processes, memory, and hardware resources.
In terms of **IPC mechanisms**, user-space processes communicate with each other through system calls to the kernel. For example:
* When using [pipes](), [message queues](), or [shared memory](), a process in user-space makes a system call (like ``pipe()``, ``msgget()``, ``shmget()``) to request the kernel to set up and manage the IPC resources.
* The **kernel** facilitates the actual data exchange and synchronization. The kernel allocates memory, manages the resources, and ensures proper access controls between processes.
* For some IPC mechanisms like **shared memory**, after the setup by the kernel, the actual data exchange can happen directly in user-space without repeatedly going back to the kernel, making it more efficient.

In short, **user-space processes rely on the kernel** to manage IPC mechanisms, and system calls act as the bridge between user-space and kernel-space to ensure controlled and secure communication between processes.
# Linux kernel

The **Linux kernel** is the lowest level of software running on a Linux system. It is charged with managing the hardware, running user programs, and maintaining the overall security and integrity of the whole system.

Tasks performed by the kernel:

* Process scheduling
* Memory management
* Provision of a file system
* Creation and termination of processes
* Access to devices
* Networking
* Provision of a system call application programming interface (API)

Kernel can be divided into 3 types: monolithic, microkernel, and hybrid. Linux use monolithic kernel. OS X (XNU) and Windows 7 use hybrid kernel.

Android use Linux Kernel. Windows and Windows Phone use NT kernel. OS X and iOS use Darwin kernel.
