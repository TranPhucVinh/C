### xTaskCreate()

```c
BaseType_t xTaskCreate( TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode, const char * const pcName, uint16_t usStackDepth, void *pvParameters, UBaseType_t uxPriority, TaskHandle_t *pxCreatedTask );
```

``pvTaskCode``: a pointer to the function that implements the task (in effect, just the name of the function

``pcName``: a descriptive name for the task. This is not used by FreeRTOS in any way. It is included purely as a debugging aid. Identifying a task by a human readable name is much simpler than attempting to identify it by its handle.

``usStackDepth``: Each task has its own unique stack that is allocated by the kernel to the task when the task is created. The usStackDepth value tells the kernel how large to make the stack.

``pvParameters``: Task functions accept a parameter of type pointer to void ( void* ). The value assigned to pvParameters is the value passed into the task.

``uxPriority``: Defines the priority at which the task will execute. Priorities can be assigned from 0, which is the lowest priority, to (configMAX_PRIORITIES â€“ 1), which is the highest priority.

``pxCreatedTask``: pxCreatedTask can be used to pass out a handle to the task being created. This handle can then be used to reference the task in API calls that, for example, change the task priority or delete the task. If your application has no use for the task handle, then pxCreatedTask can be set to NULL.
