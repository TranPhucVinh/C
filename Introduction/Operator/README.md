# [Unary operators]()
Unary operators are the operators that perform operations on **a single operand** to produce a new value. Unary operators include:
* Minus ``â€“``: Negates the value of its operand. For example, if i is 5, then -i is -5.
* [Increment ++](Symbol%20operator.md#increment-operator--i-prefix-and-i-postfix): ++i (prefix) and i++ (postfix)
* Decrement ``--``
* [NOT operator !](Unary%20operators.md#not-operator-): Invert the boolean value of its operand.
* Ampersand operator/address of: ``&``
* sizeof()
# Binary operators
Binary operators are operators that take two operands. These operators are used for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, bitwise operations, and assignment.

## Math operators
**% operator**

An arithmetic property of **%** operator: If 
```c
a % m = a1
b % m = b1
```
Then ``(a + b) % m = (a1 + b2)``
