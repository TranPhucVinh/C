# [Unary operators]()
Unary operators are the operators that perform operations on **a single operand** to produce a new value. Unary operators include:
* Minus ``â€“``: Negates the value of its operand. For example, if i is 5, then -i is -5.
* [Increment ++](Unary%20operators.md#increment-operator--i-prefix-and-i-postfix): ++i (prefix) and i++ (postfix)
* Decrement ``--``
* [NOT operator !](Unary%20operators.md#not-operator-): Invert the boolean value of its operand.
* [Complement operator ~]()
* Ampersand operator/address of: ``&``
* sizeof()
# Binary operators
Binary operators are operators that take two operands. These operators are used for **arithmetic**, **comparison**, **logical operations**, **bitwise operations**, and **assignment**.

**Arithmetic operators** perform mathematical operations:
* ``+`` : Addition
* ``-`` : Subtraction
* ``*``: Multiplication
* ``/`` : Division
* ``%`` : Modulus (remainder of division)

**Comparison operators**
* ``==`` : Equal to
* ``!=`` : Not equal to
* ``>`` : Greater than
* ``<`` : Less than
* ``>=`` : Greater than or equal to
* ``<=`` : Less than or equal to

**Assignment operators** perform an operation and then assign the result to the variable.
* = : Assignment
* += : Add and assign
* -= : Subtract and assign
* *= : Multiply and assign
* /= : Divide and assign
* %= : Modulus and assign
* &= : Bitwise AND and assign
* |= : Bitwise OR and assign
* ^= : Bitwise XOR and assign
* ``<<=`` : Left shift and assign
* ``>>=`` : Right shift and assign

**Logical operators** are used to combine conditional statements:

* && : Logical AND
* || : Logical OR

* [OR operator |]()
* [AND operator &]()
* **NOT operator with complement operator ~**
* [XOR operator ^]()
* [Bit shifting](): << Left shift and >> Right shift
