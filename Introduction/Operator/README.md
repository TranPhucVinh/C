# [Unary operators]()
Unary operators are the operators that perform operations on **a single operand** to produce a new value. Unary operators include:
* Minus ``â€“``: Negates the value of its operand. For example, if i is 5, then -i is -5.
* [Increment ++](Symbol%20operator.md#increment-operator--i-prefix-and-i-postfix): ++i (prefix) and i++ (postfix)
* Decrement ``--``
* [NOT operator !](Unary%20operators.md#not-operator-): Invert the boolean value of its operand.
* Ampersand operator/address of: ``&``
* sizeof()
# Binary operators
Binary operators are operators that take two operands. These operators are used for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, bitwise operations, and assignment.

**Arithmetic operators** perform mathematical operations:

* ``+`` : Addition
* ``-`` : Subtraction
* ``*``: Multiplication
* ``/`` : Division
* ``%`` : Modulus (remainder of division)

**Comparison operators**
* ``==`` : Equal to
* ``!=`` : Not equal to
* ``>`` : Greater than
* ``<`` : Less than
* ``>=`` : Greater than or equal to
* ``<=`` : Less than or equal to
