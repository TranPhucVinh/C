# Math operators
**% operator**

An arithmetic property of **%** operator: If 
```c
a % m = a1
b % m = b1
```
Then ``(a + b) % m = (a1 + b2)``
# Unary operators
Unary operators are the operators that perform operations on **a single operand** to produce a new value. Unary operators include:
* Minus ``â€“``: Negates the value of its operand. For example, if i is 5, then -i is -5.
* [Increment ++](Symbol%20operator.md#increment-operator--i-prefix-and-i-postfix): ++i (prefix) and i++ (postfix)
* Decrement ``--``
* [NOT operator !](): Invert the boolean value of its operand.
* Ampersand operator/address of: ``&``
* sizeof()

**Minus operator**
```c
int a = 10;
int b = -a;  // b = -10
```
The **subtraction operator** and **the minus operator** refer to the same symbol - but are used in different contexts.
