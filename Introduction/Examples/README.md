## Examples

### Sum from 1 to n

Features: Number ``n`` entered as ``main()`` argument

Handle error:

* Must enter 1 parameter for n, less than 1 or more than 1 parameter is not accepted.
* Accept value of ``n`` is integer ``2147483647``
* Negative number is not accepted
* Invalid number ``123abc`` is not accepted (for the parsing operation of ``atoi()``)

For the max accepted number of ``2147483647``, the result must be ``unsigned long int``, not ``int``.
