# [Fundamental concepts](Fundamental%20concepts.md)

* [Build a struct](Fundamental%20concepts.md#build-a-struct), [address of a struct]()
* [struct as data type of function]()
* [struct as a function argument]()
* [Function as member of a struct](): [Function without arguments]() and [Function with arguments]()
* **Memory problem with struct**: Check [overflow memset() in Memory](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/blob/master/Physical%20layer/Memory/API/memset.md#overflow-memset) for the overflow issue with struct
* [Size of struct](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/blob/master/Introduction/Data%20structure/struct/Size%20of%20struct.md)
* [Struct pointer](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/blob/master/Introduction/Data%20structure/struct/struct%20pointer.md)
* [Bit field](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/blob/master/Introduction/Data%20structure/struct/Bit%20field.md)
* [Self referential struct](https://github.com/TranPhucVinh/C/blob/master/Introduction/Data%20structure/struct/Self%20referential%20struct.md)

# [Examples](Examples)

* [Enter value for struct member using scanf()]()
* [Nested struct]()
* [Form an uint16_t number from 2 uint8_t numbers with struct]()
* [Use struct for string parsing](Examples/Use%20struct%20for%20string%20parsing.md)
