``process.h`` is a C header file which contains function declarations and macros used in working with threads and processes.
Most C compilers that target DOS, Windows 3.1x, Win32, OS/2, Novell NetWare or DOS extenders supply this header and the library functions in their C library. 
Neither the header file nor most of the functions are defined by either the ANSI/ISO C standard or by POSIX.

If you are on linux or compile with c99/ansi standard, ``process.h`` will not be available.
